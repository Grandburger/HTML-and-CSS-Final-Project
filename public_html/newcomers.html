                <h3>Johnny Cash</h3>
                <p>Johnny Cash, a name widely known. He was America's bad boy guitar star of the 50s all the way
                to his death in 2003.</p>
                <p>He was most widely known as the "Outlaw Rock Star" personality. He almost always wore black
                and many of his songs had a deep and honest message on the absurd nature of a hard man's life.</p>
                <p>Such hit songs you may have hear are 'Man In Black' or 'Walk the Line'</p>

                <h3>Johnny Horton</h3>
                <p>Johnny Horton was much less popular compared to Johnny Cash, however they where both good friends.
                Johnny Horton played music in the 50s and sadly, passed away in 1960 at the young age of 35.</p>
                <p>Johnny Horton was known as the 'Singing Fisherman' many speculate this was because of Mr.
                Horton's calm folk grass roots nature.</p>
                <p>One of his most popular songs that also won a grammy for best country and western recording in 1960
                was 'The Battle of New Orleans' a personal favorite of mine as well.</p>
