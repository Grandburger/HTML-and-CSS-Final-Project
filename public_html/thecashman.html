                <h3>The Man in Black himself</h3>
                <p>Mr. Cash was born on February 26th in Kingsland, Arkansas and was of English/Scottish descent.
                He was the fourth of seven children in his family.
                According to data of the United States Census in 1930, the population of this town
                was only around 330 people!</p>
                <p>Johnny Cash unfortunately Grew up around a tough time in American history,
                the great depression, World war 2 and Korea! This probably played a key influence in his
                music for gaining the reputation of a somewhat outlaw type of folk/country.</p>
                <p>Johnny Cash enlisted in the Air Force on July 7th 1950, the Air Force is know to be a branch
                of military excellence, and to earn even an enlistment was no small feat, surely Mr. Cash was an intelligent man.
                His job in the Air Force was a morse code operator intercepting Soviet transmissions. Only July 3rd 1954,
                he was Honorably Discharged as a staff sergeant. To gain the rank of a Staff NCO is no small feat! To add,
                honorably!</p>
                <p>He had been married twice and had 5 children. One of which being famous actress Rosanne and Famous country
                    folk musician John Carter!</p>
                <p>Later in his life, he began recording music after the military and became somewhat of a hit, to add
                much of his personality and music was new and favored, due to it's bad boy, 'Outlaw Image'. On the right
                you can find a table of his records and labels! Of which studio albums there where close to 50!</p>
