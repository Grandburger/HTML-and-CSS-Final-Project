            <h3>Ole Slew Foot</h3>
            <p>Johnny Horton was born in Los Angeles, California April 30th, 1925.
            He was the youngest of his five siblings. Although born in California, he was raised in Rusk,
            Texas and according to the US Census of 1920 was a decent small town of 2400 or so people.
            His family where migrant fruit pickers who went to California for work. Much like the novel 'Grapes of Wrath'
            Mr. Horton had an honest and tough upbringing into his life, surviving the Greats Depression, World War 2 and Korea.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, it was for this reason, among others that Mr. Cash and Mr. Horton became friends.
            They both had lived similar harder lives than most and both enjoyed the guitar, folk and country music.</p>
            <p>Horton later moved back to California as a young man. He worked as a mail clerk at Selznick International Pictures.
            It was there he met his future Wife Donna Cook who was a secretary working at the same studio.
            He later studied Geology in Seattle in 1948. He traveled to Alaska to begin a venture looking for gold.
            It was not very successful, but would later inspire him to try his hand at music.</p>
            <p>Horton returned to Texas the state which he was raised and with many songs he had written during his
            time in Alaska, He had entered a talent show and won for his efforts.
            Horton was encouraged and emboldened by this ovation and appreciation that people had for his music and again
            would return to California to pursue a music career, the place of his birth.</p>
            <p>In 1952 Horton signed a deal to create 10 singles for a label which he worked for at the time called Cormac Record Label.</p>
            <p>Later Horton enjoyed the life and luxury of a 'hillbilly hero' though, much was due to his own fine efforts
            Truly Horton was a man who had come from nothing and became something, much like his friend Johnny Cash.</p>
            <p>Horton passed away in 1960, he had died in a wreck traveling to a show on the road. His funeral was held in Shreveport Louisiana.
            Johnny Cash had attended his funeral and read chapter 20 from the 'Book of John'.</p>
